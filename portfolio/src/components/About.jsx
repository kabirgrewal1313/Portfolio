          I’m Kabir, a developer who enjoys building thoughtful, real-world
          solutions at the intersection of technology and creativity. I’m
          especially interested in backend systems, application development, and
          LLMs, where clean design, performance, and problem-solving come
          together. With a strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms,
          Object-Oriented Programming, and Database Systems, I enjoy working
          across the stack, from designing efficient APIs and backend logic to
          crafting intuitive, polished user experiences. I’ve worked with
          technologies like C++, Java, JavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL, and have
          hands-on experience in machine learning and LLM-based systems,
          including projects involving optimization and model interpretability.
          Beyond code, I’m someone who values exploration and expression. I love
          traveling, getting lost in books as a true bookworm, and staying
          connected to the arts through acting and cultural activities. These
          interests shape how I think creatively, empathetically, and with a
          global perspective. I’m always excited to learn, build, and
          collaborate on ideas that have meaningful impact.
