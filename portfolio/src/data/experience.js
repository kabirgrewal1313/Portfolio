    description:
      "I worked on developing an agentic AI–driven finance terminal designed to help retail traders efficiently process large volumes of market information and make informed, data-driven decisions. My role involved aggregating and unifying market, contextual, and metadata from multiple open-source APIs, followed by preprocessing and structuring the data to improve signal quality for machine learning and LLM-based workflows. I also designed and implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ground LLM responses in external data and reduce hallucinations, and contributed to the LLM application layer by implementing prompt chaining using LangChain to enhance reasoning flow and response consistency.",
